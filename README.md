# Coding-Practice-Repository
Follow along my coding journey as this repository showcases my completed SQL solutions from StrataScratch. It functions as a learning journal for practicing and reinforcing core SQL skills such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.

Each query reflects a problem I’ve solved independently. The repository supports continuous learning while developing strong, repeatable problem-solving approaches.
